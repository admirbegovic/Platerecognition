# Meraki MV Sense Plate Recognizer
The goal of this project is to automatically detect the license plate on a car by the MV72 camera and save the results to an SQL DB.

# License
This license is free, enables our customers and partners to do everything they need to do with the code, but also provides Cisco the limitations and protections we need in order to keep the policy and process requirements for sample code sharing as lightweight and streamlined as possible.

# Installation
Enter the required information and credentials in the config.py file.

Scripts are expected to be executed in a trusted environment with proper security settings. 

Registration on platerecognizer.com is required with an optional paid subscription.
